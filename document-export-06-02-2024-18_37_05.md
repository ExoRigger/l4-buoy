# Technical Design Doc: L4 Buoy Instrument Management & Control System

## Summary
The Instrument Management and Control System is an electronic control system designed for the Western Channel Observatory's (WCO) mooring platforms to manage power and log & transmit data from commissioned sensing instruments. The system provides multi-channel power distribution delivered to independent payload channels each with an optional analog/digital data interface for logging data to an industrial processor. Collected data is mirrored  locally and remotely using a secure and redundant communication solution. The computer operates a power management system composed of a micro controller and an array of high side switches and measures voltages and electrical currents in each channel to monitor the power consumption of each attached system. 

## Background
Modern mooring platforms are equipped with large arrays of sensing and communication equipment responsible for in-situ monitoring and scheduled data telemetry to local and remote destinations. These platforms will contain battery banks and possibly even input generation sources to keep installed systems running. Common technical challenges that arise are instrument reliability;  interoperable payload systems integration; and effective systems monitoring (e.g. power consumption) onboard the platform.  The result of these incur heavy cost on the maintenance and upkeep of these platforms as they increase in size and complexity, and also as they degrade in production. The design emphasis of the IMCS focuses on these challenges by providing a suite of peripheral interfaces and flexible remote power management tools that allow a platform operator to remotely power and configure instruments and reduce the amount of physical intervention required.

## Problem
The IMCS is motivated by the need for a robust control system that can operate under minimal supervision and with low maintenance cycles at sea for long periods of time (>1year). 

Base requirements of the system:

- Provide stable power to attached payload instruments
- 'Plug and play' requirements for instrument testing
- Remote monitoring and configuration through a robust telemetry solution
- Low power: ideally should be sustainable within platform power constraints  (12V, 600Ah System with power generation dependent on solar/wind).
- Support a variety of low voltage systems (3.3V, 5V, 12V, 24V)
- Operate on platforms at sea for long periods (over one year)
The system should be modular so that it is easy to maintain and replace components during faults. 

The system must be designed to be supplied by a 12V 600Ah battery supply that is occasionally charged by an array of 12V 400W solar panels and a 12V 300W wind turbine. 

The system must have independent power distribution channels that protect the main components and payload channels with the appropriate safety circuity.

All components to be securely fastened in a ventilated watertight enclosure with regular refreshment of desiccants to maximize lifetime in harsh environments. 

Successful execution of this system will increase the productivity of autonomous platforms and their operators while also reducing the cost to operate and maintain them through less ship-time and logistical operations required to access or transport the platform.



## Hardware Design
The system's primary purpose is to collect data and manage power.

Power is managed using automotive grade hardware (infineon). A microcontroller is used to drive a series of power management modules, each with a number of channels that provide power switching and current measurement via the microcontroller's I/O pins.  

Data is collected using industrial grade hardware. Telemetry from RS232, RS422, and RS485 protocols is handled by a USB Serial hub (Startech) and raw analog data is acquired through a 16bit ADC unit. Both systems are connected to a ruggedized PC via USB and provide the data interface for attached instruments.

The solar controller provides 12V 45A through its load terminal. The main system is constrained to a 32A draw through a C32A circuit breaker. This implies that in a 16-channel build each channel should not exceed 2A continuous current draw at once, and all 16 channels (plus the main system) must not exceed 32A continuous draw. Since many devices are rated to mW consumption, some channels will never exceed this in normal circumstances. It is still important to budget the power accordingly and prevent overloading. 

The appropriate sized wiring must also be considered: 2.5mm^2 wiring into the safety systems and 0.75mm^2 / 1.0mm^2 for the main control systems + payload systems. Consider using shielded twisted cable pairs for signal wires to reduce interference.  

The main system powers the IMCS power management system; the onboard PC; and the data acquisition interfaces. The main PC initiates logging systems for the IMCS power management and other attached instruments.

Each payload power channel is mediated by a fused high-side switch with current sensing to provide remote power switching and power monitoring (Infineon PROFET BTS family).

Data acquisition can be performed by interfacing with a serial-usb hub and analog-usb peripherals. Other interfaces (I2C, CAN, SPI, LVDS) are also available. 

Data from these interfaces are collected by an industrial fanless PC (Windows 10 IoT 2017 LTSC). This also receives power and instrument status data from the IMCS micro controller. Collected data is mirrored onto a secondary SSD and synced to PML's shore servers every hour through an ad-hoc network (Persistent Systems L-band MPU5) (add comms section)

The platform will be installed with a core set of payload instrumentation. Namely in-water CTD, pH, surface PAR and network camera systems.

The network cameras are connected to the platform's LAN via RJ45 into the network switch, allowing the PC to collect image data. 

The CTD and pH use RS-232 and stream data to one of the serial interfaces for the PC to access over USB. 

The PAR sensor streams an analog signal to the ADC. The computer polls the ADC over RS-485 for the PC to access over USB.

 For additional instruments, a systems integration plan should be formulated to highlight the feasibility and necessary work to commission, operate and maintain. 

## Software Design
The microcontroller was programmed with standard C++ with additional low level driver libraries developed by Infineon. The microcontroller initializes and streams information about each power management module: It reports the voltage of each module and their channel's state and current draw to the onboard PC via USB Serial. The controller can also be polled for this information and sent commands to toggle the state of or cycle a channel.

The onboard PC operates on Windows 10 and contains python scripts responsible for individually logging the data of each instrument when necessary. These are simple scripts that utilize PySerial to access the data acquisition hardware interfaces to listen for data streamed from a specified instrument. The Logging module is used to provide rolling logs in ISO-8601 format. (UML ins)



Some instruments will stream data on power-on while some require additional configuration.  The base python scripts only listen for data on a specified interface, additional software must be written in the case a sensor needs further setup.

Similarly, some of the logged data is pre-calibrated by the instrument whereas some sensors provide raw measurements that require processing. Additional software will be required to process the data from these sensors.

A similar python script is used for the microcontroller information logging but also provides the ability to send commands manually/automatically. 

A scheduling program (cron) will invoke rsync on an automatic schedule (@hourly) to copy backups of the data to a secondary SSD and transmit data.



The data collected from each of the core instruments is staged into raw and partially processed data, this is clearly defined by the following staging process which occurs locally onboard the platform:

- Level 0 Data: Raw files acquired directly from an instrument's telemetry interface and stored onboard the platform PC's primary and secondary storage in a basic format (i.e. "C:\data\instrument\instrument_data.dat"). Some of this data may already be calibrated due to onboard sensors, whereas some data will need to be converted with the appropriate calibration files.
- Level 1 Data: Accumulated files for each instrument over a 24hrs are collapsed into a single file (labelled as 'daily' file) containing a statistically filtered representation of the data. This will provide, in 1hr intervals, a mean and standard deviation for each measurement made by the instrument. Each instrument's daily file is then used to create a final daily file containing column separated hourly measurements of all instruments considered in the process.
## Considerations
### Test plan
What are the failure scenarios we are going to cover in our testing?

A base case of failure scenarios proposed:

> When a payload sensor is unresponsive

> When a main system component is unresponsive

> When remote data sync fails

> When scheduled or platform communications fail (temporary + permanently) 

### Security
Physical security at sea is restricted to cases where the mooring platform is at risk of collision or targeted for vandalism/salvage. In the former case, the platform is equipped with a navigation light and is a special mark on marine charts. The latter case is something to consider.

Electronics are mechanically bolted within IP65 rated enclosures with desiccants to maximize their lifetime. The securing bolts and fasteners are checked and tightened if required during scheduled maintenance.

Integration of instrument software onboard the payload computer may cause instability if not shore-tested to satisfaction. Advisable to test on a shore-based replication of IMCS as part of a full integration test. 

Network security: 

The network switch provides a LAN for the PC and other connected devices. This is also where the telemetry gateways are connected.

## Definition of success
During shallow in-water tests, the system must successfully maintain power to core and auxiliary payload instruments and, for those with data interfaces, transmit data to the payload PC. The PC must log this data and successfully telemeter the data to a remote server on a defined schedule. It should be possible to successfully power cycle and remotely configure any attached instrument as required. When communications are available, it should be possible to remotely access the payload PC and attached payload instruments to inspect and verify nominal functionality.

During station tests, the system must be operable without physical intervention, with the exception to routine maintenance and pre-planned mechanical + electrical integration of additional instruments. It should be possible to configure and troubleshoot remotely as required, and any failure /anomaly in the system should be logged on-board for further analysis.
